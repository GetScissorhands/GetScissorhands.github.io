Since [Scissorhands.NET](http://getscissorhands.net) was initially released its [alpha version](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Scissorhands.NET/) in January, 2016, it hasn't got updated so far because of various reasons. The initial release was written in ASP.NET Core RC1. Now ASP.NET Core has released 1.0.1. It's time to rewrite the code. Actually most bits and pieces can be reused but I wouldn't hurry.

> Slow and steady wins the race.
